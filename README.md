Hi there!

This is a `scientific calculator` using javascript

# OBJECTIVE:
The main purpose of building this project is to implement my learning of javascript on some project.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
As this is a scientific calculator it has more than arithmetic operations. I add trignometric ratios like `sin` , `cos` and `tan`. I also add `square root` and `cube root`.
I add `square` and `cube` feature. 


# SOFTWARE I USED:
I have used **Visual Studio Code** and I suggest you to use it because it has everything which a programmer expects from ny code editor with some additional and useful features. It is lightweight , fast , open source and cross-platform.

# FILES NEEDED TO BUILD A CALCULATOR:
I create three files in the project

## Index.html
To build the **structure** of my project 

## Style.css
To **style** my calculator so that it looks attractive

## Index.js
This is my script file where I write all the **javascript code**.

Fisrt add the link of your css file inside the head tag of html file

<head></head>

Then add js link inside the body tag of html file
<body></body>

# RESPONSIVE:

Additionally I used **bootstrap** to make it resposnive. You can also write `media queries`
But if using bootstrap copy the css link from bootstrap website add the link inside the head tag of html file

# BUILTIN FUNCTIONS OF JAVASCRIPT I USED:

sin = to calculate sine function of a number
cos = to calculate cosine function of a number
tan = to calculate tangent function of a number
pow = to calculate powers / root of a number
eval = to evaluate the argument
substr = to returns the part of the string between the start and end indexes, or to the end of the string.

# FUNCTIONS IN JS FILE:

These are all the functions I create in script file:
