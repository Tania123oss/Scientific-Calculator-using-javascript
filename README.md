Hi there!

This is a scietific calculator using javascript

OBJECTIVE:
The main purpose of building this project is to implement my learning of javascript on some project.

SOFTWARE I USED:
I have used Visual Studio Code and I suggest you to use it because it has everything which a programmer expects from ny code editor with some additional and useful features. It is lightweight , fast , open source and cross-platform.

FILES TO BUILD A CALCULATOR:
I create three files in the project

Index.html
To build the structure of my project 

Style.css
To style my calculator so that it looks attractive

Idex.js
This is my script file where I write all the javascript code.
