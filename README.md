Hi there!

This is a scietific calculator using javascript

OBJECTIVE:
The main purpose of building this project is to implement my learning of javascript on some project.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
As this is a scientific calculator it has more than arithmetic operations. I add trignometric ratios like sin , cos and tan. I also add square root and cube root.
I add square and cube feature. 
This is the whole look of my scientific calculator.
SOFTWARE I USED:
I have used Visual Studio Code and I suggest you to use it because it has everything which a programmer expects from ny code editor with some additional and useful features. It is lightweight , fast , open source and cross-platform.

FILES NEEDED TO BUILD A CALCULATOR:
I create three files in the project

Index.html
To build the structure of my project 

Style.css
To style my calculator so that it looks attractive

Index.js
This is my script file where I write all the javascript code.


Fisrt add the link of your css file inside the head tag of html file

Then add js link inside the body tag of html file

BUILTIN FUNCTIONS OF JAVASCRIPT I USED:
sin = to calculate sine function of a number
cos = to calculate cosine function of a number
tan = to calculate tangent function of a number
pow = to calculate powers / root of a number
eval = to evaluate the argument
substr = to returns the part of the string between the start and end indexes, or to the end of the string.
